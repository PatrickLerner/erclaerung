# erclaͤrung™

erclaͤrung™ was born out of a simple dream: To create the best analyzer and text classifier for Early Modern German texts.

This is being accomplished by utilizing [dkpro-core](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/) and [dkpro-tc](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-tc/).

The primary corpora for this project which is used to aid in the classification is the [Bonner Frühneuhochdeutschkorpora](http://korpora.zim.uni-due.de/Fnhd/), which is available online.

Note that due to the licensing terms of the Bonner corpora, it is *not* supplied with this project. You must download the XML files from their website and put them into the `src/main/resources/bonner_korpora` folder of this project.
