# erclaͤrung™

erclaͤrung™ was born out of a simple dream: To create the best analyzer and text classifier for Early Modern German texts.

This is being accomplished by utilizing [dkpro-core](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/) and [dkpro-tc](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-tc/). The main corpora for this project is [Bonner Frühneuhochdeutschkorpora](http://korpora.zim.uni-due.de/Fnhd/) available online.
